<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>My name is Michael Tran. I am a rising senior studying Computer Science at Boston University. I'm interested in 
  software engineering, cybersecurity, and am looking forward to exploring more about artificial intelligence.
  I love to dabble in fashion and explore how social media influences current trends on what makes something "acceptable."
  I also love public transporation, and am a huge film watcher (not critic), especially A24. Based in New York City, I 
  am curious about cultural exposure through traveling; I studied abroad in Paris in the Summer of 2022, and look forward
  to seeing new and different parts of the world in the future (Dream destination: Morocco!).
